How Divide and Conquer Algorithms Work?
Here are the steps involved:

	Divide: 
Divide the given problem into sub-problems using recursion.
	Conquer: 
Solve the smaller sub-problems recursively. If the subproblem is small enough, then solve it directly.
	Combine: 
Combine the solutions of the sub-problems that are part of the recursive process to solve the actual problem.
